# Text-to-3D-convertor

This project is a powerful tool designed to transform text prompts into 3D models using the SHAP-E model. Ideal for applications in gaming, virtual reality, and design, it leverages cutting-edge text-to-3D technology to generate high-quality and versatile 3D assets. Built in Google Colab for ease of use, this tool provides an accessible way for users to bring their text ideas to life in a 3D format without extensive computational resources.

## Features
- **Text-Based Input:** Simply input descriptive text prompts to generate 3D models.
- **High-Quality Output:** Utilizes SHAP-E for detailed and realistic model generation.
- **Broad Applications:** Suitable for creative fields like gaming, AR/VR, and digital design.
- **User-Friendly Setup:** Accessible via Google Colab with minimal setup requirements.

## How to Use
1. Open the provided Google Colab notebook.
2. **Switch to GPU**: 
   - Go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type`.
   - Under **Hardware accelerator**, select **T4 GPU** instead of **None (CPU)**.
   - Click **Save** to apply the changes.
3. Input your text prompt in the designated cell.
4. Run the code to generate and visualize the 3D model based on the prompt.

## Requirements
- Google Colab
- Basic Python knowledge for customizing prompts and fine-tuning outputs
