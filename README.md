Text to 3D Converter

This project is a powerful tool designed to transform text prompts into 3D models using the SHAP-E model. Ideal for applications in gaming, virtual reality, and design, it leverages cutting-edge text-to-3D technology to generate high-quality and versatile 3D assets. Built in Google Colab for ease of use, this tool provides an accessible way for users to bring their text ideas to life in a 3D format without extensive computational resources.

Features:
Text-Based Input: Simply input descriptive text prompts to generate 3D models.
High-Quality Output: Utilizes SHAP-E for detailed and realistic model generation.
Broad Applications: Suitable for creative fields like gaming, AR/VR, and digital design.
User-Friendly Setup: Accessible via Google Colab with minimal setup requirements.

How to Use:
Open the provided Google Colab notebook.
Input your text prompt in the designated cell.
Run the code to generate and visualize the 3D model based on the prompt.

Requirements:
Google Colab
Basic Python knowledge for customizing prompts and fine-tuning outputs
